# Shovel Engine

A very work-in-progress voxel engine, my first major C/C++ project as well. 

Built using old school Makefiles, compiled with GCC (MinGW-w64), written in Sublimetext 3. 

#### Update:
I actually really dislike how the code ended up, I'm rewriting it all again to just pure C. Why C? I just like C.
Also build tools, CMake is the way to go. So this repo is dead.


# Other
Due to my foolish use of proprietary Consolas font and the questionable inclusion of the libraries used, this shouldn't be public here at all (and wasn't until my github educational license ran out). I cannot give this a free license for now.
